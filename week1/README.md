# Q&A Week 1

## Today's Agenda

(Start recording!)

- How was your (study) week?
- Prep exercise: Cat Walk
  - What do you think the advantages are of having the constants in the global scope? Are there any disadvantages?
  - To make the code loop we cannot use a standard JavaScript loop (`for` or `while`). Why is that?
  - Do you feel this version is easier to read than the version you made in the Browsers module?
  - Is this version more efficient or not or does it not matter?
- Promise experiments
- Event loop experiments

  One break around 13:15.

- Go through questions

- If time left: Cat Walk using callbacks

## Questions

### Nida Ul Zafar

My first question is regarding `$.get()` and `new Promise()`. In the video tutorial the tutor used `new XMLHttpRequest()`; inside the `new Promise()` and later showed `$.get()` way of writing promise. Are they same or is there any difference between the two? what should we choose as a junior developer?

For video reference please click here.

`$.get()` method starts at 10:25

my second question is about generators in asynchronous javascript. Is it important for a junior developer to program using generators as it seems quite complicated?
